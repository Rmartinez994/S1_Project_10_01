captions1
00:01.00 --> 00:004.000
We observe today

captions2
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
not a victory of party,

captions3
00:06.00 --> 00:10.000
but a celebration of freedom â€“

captions 4
00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
symbolizing an end,

captions5
00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
as well as a beginning â€“

captions6
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
signifying renewal,

captions7
00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
as well as change.

captions8
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
For I have sworn before you

captions9
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
and Almighty God

captions10
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
the same solemn oath

captions11
00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
our forebears prescribed

captions12
00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
nearly a century and three-quarters ago
